#+TITLE: MoMA experiments
* BK - Major guide - EJML = Evil\_J Max losses 

All attacks done with a MoMA - no vets or majors used. The blocks are
the same as Evil\_J's Major Gen guide - the MoMA fights fast enough so
far.  My results can probably be bettered a lot - i did very little
simming using http://www.settlersonlinetools.com/en/combat_simulator/.
Not that different from letting him run with 220R for all attacks tho

L4 sim avg loss - 46.09R (shouldn't lose anything else according to sim). That's the only camp where Evil\_J uses a Major General

DC1 - can send 220R avg loss 109R
