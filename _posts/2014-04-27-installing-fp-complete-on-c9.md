### Setting up ghc (and hopefully eventually fpcomplete) on C9

Starting from here: <http://www.haskell.org/platform/linux.html>

Downloaded ghc from here <http://www.haskell.org/ghc/download_ghc_7_6_3>

Now trying to get libgmp.so.3 by starting here -
<https://gmplib.org/list-archives/gmp-announce/2009-May/000023.html>

### Notes

- jekyll needed language env vars on C9 cuz of new version - see c9rj
and c9rjsw (for setting the port and IP)
