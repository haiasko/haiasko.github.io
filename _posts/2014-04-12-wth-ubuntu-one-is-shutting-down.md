## Just got this in the mail: ##

> Hi,

>We are writing to you to notify you that we will be shutting down the
Ubuntu One file services, effective 1 June 2014. This email gives
information about the closure and what you should expect during the
shutdown process.

>As of today, it will no longer be possible to purchase storage or music
from the Ubuntu One store. The Ubuntu One file services apps in the Ubuntu,
Google, and Apple stores will be updated appropriately.

>As always, your content belongs to you.  You can simply download your files
onto your PC or an external hard drive.  While the service will stop as of
1 June, you will have an additional two months (until 31 July 2014) to
collect all of your content. After that date, all remaining content will
be deleted.

>If you have an active annual subscription, the unused portion of your fees
will be refunded. The refund amount will be calculated from today's
announcement.

>We know you have come to rely on Ubuntu One, and we apologise for the
inconvenience this closure may cause.  We've always been inspired by the
support, feedback and enthusiasm of our users and want to thank you for
the support you've shown for Ubuntu One. We hope that you'll continue to
support us as together we bring a revolutionary experience to new devices.

>The Ubuntu One team

I did rely on Ubuntu One for quite some time, well still there's
[Dropbox] which i happen to like a lot recently and [Google Docs].
