## TSO test server checklist (roughly in that order) at account wipe:

- buy jolly geologists, train 1 for max copper, and science him all
- check marlbe masons and make them 5 asap, buff them asap
- epic workyard, place it near working buildings
- buy as many gempits as you like (maybe 1) and place next to the epic woodyard for testing the buff
- make 3 fast endless copper mines (might combine it with building the guild house and the other mines, beware marble!)
- buy a MMoA and the other gens
- start making an army
- train a coalie geo and use him for coal only
- check if you need more stone masons and fishermen
