### where is our guild FP bonus invested2? 20 * 4 = 80, soon to be 20 * 5. Ryder's TA first 3 levels are 90 + 170 + 240 = 500, meaning 25FPs per guildie, still less than 28 weekly FPs. And that for the most expensive GB in game.

### It is ridiculous to leave any GB below 3 for such a long time.  Yes, for a TA it is 25 FPs per guildie.  Do you forget that you will build more GBs too and they will receive the same treatment?

### Maybe some perspective is in order - BB was a top 10 guild for quite some time with very few players.  We have fallen to 15th in rank and i sure do know we can do much better.  We don't belong to the 2nd page of guild rankings.
